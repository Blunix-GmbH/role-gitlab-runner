# Ansible Role gitlab-runner
This role installs and configures a gitlab-runner with docker.

# TODO
- pull in docker in molecule and install it (can we do this without force stating a version but just use latest?)
- tests: `gitlab-ci-multi-runner status` exit status

# Example play
An example play can be found in `molecule/install/playbook.yml`

# Requirements
- You will need a gitlab server with it :)
- Go to the gitlab webui, generate a runner token and use it in the play vars
- blunix.role-docker
